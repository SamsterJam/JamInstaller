# Sam's Custom Arch Linux Installer (SCALI)

This is my personal setup script designed to go from nothing to full install and setup just the way I like it. I will keep things minimal, but add all of my personal essentials for day-to-day use.

This script will setup a user with a whole bunch of stuff already setup for you and a BSPWM enviornment with my personal configuration files.
